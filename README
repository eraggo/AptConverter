Ugly "brute-forced" apt->RAPID converter
Timo Heino, 2012

Target: to convert from apt-file (somekind format at least) to RAPID program(used in ABB robot) in Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.

Yes, code is a mess! BUT! I'll try to maintain it.

tmpfile format: (can be changing)
replace "," as tabs

L <x>,<y>,<z>		linear move to x,y,z
A <x>,<y>,<z>,<r>	arc to x,y,z with radius r
I <x>,<y>,<z>		arc direction from the center
