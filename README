Ugly "brute-forced" apt->RAPID converter
Timo Heino, 2012

Target: to convert from apt-file (somekind format at least) to RAPID program(used in ABB robot) in Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.

Yed, code is a mess! BUT! I'll try to maintain it.

tmpfile format: (can be changing)
replace "," as tabs

L <x>,<y>,<z>				linear move to x,y,z
A <x>,<y>,<z>,<r>,<px>,<py>,<pz>	arc to x,y,z with radius r
					px,py,pz point in arc
I <x>,<y>,<z>				arc direction from the center
............
